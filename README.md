## ✨ How It Works

Just start typing in the notepad.

- Use `todo: your task` to mark tasks
- Type `::todo` anywhere in the notepad to trigger the To-Do List modal
- Notes and todos persist with `localStorage`—no sign-ins, no data sharing

> Example:
> ```
> todo: Update portfolio with DevUniverse
> todo: Push README.md to GitHub
> ::todo
> ```
