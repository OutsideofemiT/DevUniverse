# 🚀 DevUniverse

*A cosmic command center for developers who code with clarity.*

DevUniverse is a minimalist, ambient personal dashboard built for intentional developers. Designed to sit quietly in the background while empowering focused work, it merges a mantra-driven interface with real-time note-taking and actionable task extraction.

| 💬 **Mantra Welcome**   | Sets the tone with a guiding philosophy—*“Code. Create. Conscious.”* |

## ✨ How It Works

Just start typing in the notepad.

- Use `todo: your task` to mark tasks
- Type `::todo` anywhere in the notepad to trigger the To-Do List modal
- Notes and todos persist with `localStorage`—no sign-ins, no data sharing

> Example:
> ```
> todo: Update portfolio with DevUniverse
> todo: Push README.md to GitHub
> ::todo
> ```
